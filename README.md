# Effective XGBoost

The field of Data Science, although seemingly complex, is in essence an exploration of information and the patterns within. 

Data science encompasses various methods and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, and computer science. 
This repository is devoted to a deeper understanding of data science, particularly Machine Learning, with exercises and solutions from the well-regarded book "Effective XGBoost" (Harrison Matt, 2023).

The primary aim of this repository is to provide an accessible yet comprehensive resource to those embarking on their journey in the field of data science. The repository will provide explanations, solutions, and insights into the numerous exercises contained within the aforementioned book.

8. Create the project - (scrapy startproject folder_name)
9. Enter the folder - (cd folder_name)
```

### Github Environment

Performed from Terminal Console
```sh
1. git init
2. git remote add origin ["copy here ssh or https"]
3. git remote -v
4. git add -A
5. git add .
6. git commit -m "insert here your commit"
7. git status

```

### Additional GitHub Commands
if you already created your repository, then:
```sh
1. git remote add origin ["copy here ssh or https"] 
2. same procedure applied above
3. Note: if you already got your ReadMe.md & License.md then,
firstly request your git pull origin master. THIS IS ALWAYS A RECOMMENDED PRACTICE.
4. git push origin master
